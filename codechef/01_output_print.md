## To Print

```python
print(12) # printing a number
print("Hello world") # printing a string
print(2 + 4) # printing arithmetic operation
```

## Printing Multiple Outputs

**NOTE:** Every `print()` will print on a new line.

```python
print("99")
print(100) 
```

## Outputs on the Same Line

```python
print(1, 2, 3, 4) # Output: 1 2 3 4
```

## Inserting Text Between Outputs

```python
print("My favourite number is", 10) # Output: My favorite number is 10
```
