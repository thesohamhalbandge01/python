a = 6
b = 3

print(a + b) # addition: 9
print(a - b) # subtraction: 3
print(a * b) # multiplication: 18
print(a / b) # division: 2.0
print(10 // 3) # integer division: 3 (returns the whole number of the quotient discarding remainder)
print(a % b) # modulus: 0 (returns the remainder) 
print(a ** b) # exponentiation: 216 (a^b => 6^3 => 6 * 6 * 6 => 216)

assignment
---

length = 15 (basic assignment)

length += 15 # length = length + 15
length -= 15 # length = length - 15
length *= 15 # length = length * 15
length /= 15 # length = length / 15
length %= 15 # length = length % 15

relational (will return either True/False)
---

- a > b   (Checks if `a` is greater than `b`)
- a == b  (Checks if `a` is equal to `b`)
- a != b  (Checks if `a` is not equal to `b`)
- a >= b  (Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`)
- a <= b  (Checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`)

logical
---

1. and 
--

# The AND operator returns True only if both conditions are True.

a = 7
condition = a > 5 and a < 10  # Only True if a is greater than 5 AND less than 10
print(condition)  # Output: True

2. or
--

# The OR operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is True.

a = 7
condition = a > 10 or a < 5  # True if a is greater than 10 OR less than 5
print(condition)  # Output: False

3. not 
--

# The NOT operator reverses the result of the condition. If the condition is True, `not` makes it False. If the condition is False, `not` makes it True.

a = 7
condition = not(a > 5)  # Reverses the result of a > 5
print(condition)  # Output: False
